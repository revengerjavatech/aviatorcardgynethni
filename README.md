## What is the Aviator Game?

Aviator is an innovative and exciting game developed by Spribe that has
taken the online gambling scene by storm. The game is often categorized
as a \"crash\" game, where players bet on a multiplier that increases
over time. The goal is simple: cash out before the multiplier crashes.
The longer you wait, the higher the multiplier, but the risk of losing
increases with time. This unique mechanic has made the game highly
addictive and popular among players who enjoy a quick, action-packed
betting experience.
